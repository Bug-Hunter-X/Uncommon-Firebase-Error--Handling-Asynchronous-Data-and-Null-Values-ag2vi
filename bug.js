The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error in Firebase when attempting to access a deeply nested child within a Realtime Database reference.  The issue arises from an asynchronous nature of Firebase operations and improper handling of potential null values during data retrieval. 
```javascript
const dbRef = firebase.database().ref('users/userId/profile/address');
dbRef.once('value', (snapshot) => {
  const address = snapshot.val();
  console.log(address.street); // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'street')
});
```
This error occurs if the `address` node does not exist in the database or if there's a delay in data retrieval. Attempting to access `address.street` before `address` has been fully populated will result in an error.
