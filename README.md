# Firebase Asynchronous Data Retrieval and Null Value Handling
This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked issue in Firebase Realtime Database interactions: handling asynchronous data retrieval and potential null values. The provided code examples highlight the problem and offer a robust solution to prevent runtime errors.

## Problem
When fetching data from the Firebase Realtime Database, asynchronous operations can lead to errors if you try to access nested child values before they're completely loaded.  If a node is missing, attempting to access its properties results in a `Cannot read properties of undefined` error.

## Solution
The solution involves using optional chaining and the nullish coalescing operator to safely handle potential null or undefined values in the data.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the Firebase SDK: `npm install firebase`
3. Configure your Firebase project.
4. Replace placeholders in the code with your actual Firebase configuration.
5. Run `node bug.js` to observe the error, then `node bugSolution.js` to see the corrected code.
